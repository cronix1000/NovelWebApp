# NovelWebApp

The puprose of my application is to create a website for people to share there webnovels with some features I had wanted but hadnt seen in other apps
Used https://quilljs.com api for editor
     https://github.com/ifotn for photo adding code

The azure link https://novelwebapp.azurewebsites.net

Possibly counts as extra but sighlty more complex model views that loop over chapters specific to a novel

CSSL: Bootstrap, Vannila CSS
